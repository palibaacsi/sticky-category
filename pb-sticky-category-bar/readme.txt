== Inspiration ==
I wrote this plugin being inspired from [wpbeginner.com](http://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-create-a-sticky-floating-footer-bar-in-wordpress/ "Sticky Footer bar")
Basically,  I read a tutorial about adding this functionality at wpbeginner. In order to simplify this functionality, I have written this plugin.
This is my first plugin for WordPress and Insha'ALLAH I will try to add more functionalities to it.
